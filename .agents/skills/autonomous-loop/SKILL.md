description: Run or resume an authorized GitHub objective through planning, specification, implementation and review in Codex, pausing for consequential human decisions. Use for an autonomous development loop, not an ordinary one-off edit.

# Autonomous loop

Own the objective until its success criteria are met, a human decision is needed,
or an operational blocker has no useful next step. Continue after each task; do not
invent another objective when this one is complete. Use one coordinator and one
implementation at a time. The main agent may both plan and implement.

## Start and recover

- Read [the contract](references/contract.md) when starting a new objective or when
  its format is unfamiliar. GitHub is the durable state; conversation memory is not.
- Locate `scripts/github.mts` relative to this skill's directory. Run
  `node <skill-dir>/scripts/github.mts status <objective-number>` from the target repo.
- Read the objective's goal, success criteria and boundaries. Existing user approval
  persists; request only missing decisions. Publishing and merging follow the explicit
  permissions in the objective and the user's current authorization.
- For a test-branch pilot, record its exact name under `Integration branch` before
  claiming work. Target that branch in PRs; never silently substitute the default branch.
- On restart, read the selected task, relevant accepted decisions and its branch/PR.
  Verify ownership of an existing session before resuming its work. Never infer that
  a worktree is abandoned from its name or a missing remote branch; never delete it
  automatically. A subagent does not imply a separate worktree.

## Advance the objective

1. **Plan:** keep a short roadmap in the objective's `Plan`. Detail the next useful
   task, not the whole speculative backlog. Read the planning templates in the contract.
2. **Specify:** give that task acceptance criteria and proportionate validation.
   File hints guide discovery; overlapping paths mean sequence the work. Dependencies
   express real prerequisites. Update the spec when a decision changes it.
3. **Implement:** re-read `status`, then `claim <objective> <task>` when publishing is
   authorized. A `held` result is not permission to take another session's work.
   Work on the returned branch in an isolated checkout; reuse a verified inactive
   session/worktree on restart. Include documentation and necessary manifests in the
   same change. Add regression tests when they demonstrate the changed behavior; a
   `test(red):` commit and a negative-control run are not universal requirements.
4. **Review:** validate, then open a PR to the integration branch with `Closes #<task>`. Use an independent
   review context for code intended to merge autonomously (Codex review or a reviewer
   subagent). Give it the spec, relevant decisions and diff, not the implementer's
   reasoning history. A local review is not a GitHub approval: publish the review
   under a separate reviewer identity, or wait for a human review.
5. **Land:** `land <objective> <task>` enforces the merge permission, unresolved
   checkpoints, current-head approval and required server checks. Never bypass a
   refusal with a direct merge. When CI/review is pending, use a waiting mechanism
   or return `waiting_ci`; do not repeatedly ask the model to poll unchanged state.
6. **Reconcile:** read `status` again, incorporate evidence and take the next task.
   After all tasks, verify the objective's success criteria. Use
   `finish <objective> --evidence <file>` only with concrete completion evidence.

## Human decisions and bounded recovery

- Checkpoint a material product/scope decision, irreversible architectural commitment,
  production/data action, or cost/access beyond what the user authorized. Local
  implementation choices and test repairs remain autonomous.
- Present the question, recommendation, alternatives, consequences and which tasks
  depend on it. Record a checkpoint using the contract before dependent work proceeds.
  An unanswered or merely closed checkpoint is not approval. Continue independent work.
- Record a user's explicit answer with its source; never manufacture a decision from
  silence, a recommendation, elapsed time or a tool's success. Reuse accepted answers
  while the question and objective boundaries remain unchanged.
- Persist failed attempts and evidence in task comments. After two failed repair
  attempts without new evidence, return `blocked` with the smallest missing decision
  or resource. A restart does not reset this budget. A new human direction can.
- Keep updates short. Return one of `continue`, `waiting_human`, `waiting_ci`,
  `blocked`, or `complete`, with the objective number and a concise summary. When a
  headless runner requests one bounded transition, return `continue` after that
  transition; otherwise keep advancing until a terminal/waiting condition.
